description: >
    The role of nematicity inside the pnictide superconductors remains as a mestery. In order to investigate the critical nematic fluctuaion and its role, a insulator (TmVO4)without superconductivity serves as a playground. We find that the spin-lattice relaxation rate scales with the shear elastic constant associated with the ferroquadrupole phase transition, suggesting that <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.205137">quadrupole (nematic) fluctuations</a> dominate the spin-lattice relaxation for in-plane fields.
