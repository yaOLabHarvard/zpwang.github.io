description: >
    In order to study the magnetism of novel materials under pressure, we have developed approaches using soild spin defects as local DC and AC magnetic probes. By directly positioning <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.16.054014"> NV center </a> within the diamond anvil and generating the Boron vacancy in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03319"> hBN </a>, we demonstrated the effectiveness and potiental of the magnetometry and pressometry under high pressure.
