title: Imaging Meissner effect using NV centers
modal-id: 3

alt: Depending on the relative location to the superconducting sample, the NV center can get (A) no response (B) diamagnetic response (C) paramagnetic response
description: >
    The local NV centers in the diamond enables the magnetometry pixel by pixel. By performing simultaneous magnetometry and electrical transport measurements, we observe the dual signatures of superconductivity -- diamagnetism characteristic of the Meissner effect and a sharp drop of the resistance to near zero. See our recent work on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07026-7">Hydride</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org">Nickelate</a> superconductivity.
